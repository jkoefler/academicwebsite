# Academic Website

This is a personal academic website built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), marking my first project with this framework. The website showcases various sections such as a Hero section, Research, Teaching, and CV pages, designed to provide a comprehensive overview of a academic profile and professional achievements.

## (Upcoming) Features

- **Hero Section:** A visually engaging introduction section highlighting key information about the person.
- **Research Page:** Dedicated to showcasing academic research, publications, and ongoing projects.
- **Teaching Page:** Contains information about teaching experiences, courses taught, and other educational contributions.
- **CV Page:** A detailed curriculum vitae outlining the academic and professional background.
- **Reusable Components:** Common components like buttons, headers, and footers are reused across the website to maintain consistency.
- **Backend:** The project is designed to be extendable with a Pocketbase backend where content can be added or updated in a user-friendly and secure way. This would enable the client (or admin) to manage the websiteâ€™s content easily through a secure dashboard, without needing to manually modify the code.
